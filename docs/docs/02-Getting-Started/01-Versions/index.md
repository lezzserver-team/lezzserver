# Versions

Lezzserver coming with 2 different version `LITE` and `FULL`. initially Lezzserver deployed on cloud with full version for all its users. but now Lezzserver provide the users to freely install lezzserver in their local with minimum setup.

so the key of difference between `LITE` and `FULL`. full feature require several infrastructure setup to support it

- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Minio](https://min.io)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com)

otherwise if you use `LITE` version, you can install lite it with a single command docker or using Lezzserver CLI.
however but some feature not available

- File Storage
- Logs
- History

currently tutorial to install Lezzserver with `FULL` version not available yet, we will add it soon, stay tune

# Scheduling

Lezzserver lets you easily schedule a function to run once or repeatedly in the future. This allows you to build workflows like sending a welcome email a day after someone joins or regularly reconciling your accounts with Stripe. Lezzserver provides two different features for scheduling:

- Scheduled Functions can be scheduled by any other function to run at a later point in time. You can schedule functions minutes, days, and even months in the future.

- Cron Jobs schedule functions to run on a recurring basis, such as daily.
